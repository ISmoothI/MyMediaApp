# 📱 MyMedia App

MyMedia aims to be a fully usable offline movie tracking experience where you, the user, has complete control of the data at hand from creation to deletion! This app serves to provide a modern streaming service UI experience with entry control being fully available from the start.

Open source to allow user to modify the app layout or add/remove components as desired.
Build your movie list as soon as you launch the app.
Complete offline control which means you are responsible for all data being added or edited.
